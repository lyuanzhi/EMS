# EMS
An Server-Client Enterprise Management System (Windows desktop application) Written in QT. This project was completed in 2020 and was the first one that I ever did.

## Story
I originally planned to migrate this project over this github account directly, but while testing I found that there were some problems with the server and I needed to change the source code. However, this project was originally developed in VS 2019, but it is not currently available on my computer. So I went with Qt Creator for bug fixing. By the way, it is really interesting to fix bugs that I created four years ago.

### Issues Recording
1. SQL syntax error due to different MySQL version.
2. Chinese appears garbled due to inconsistent encoding format (Previously GBK and now UTF-8).

## Tech Stack
1. C++
2. QT5
3. MySQL

## Dependencies
1. Qt 5.12.12
2. MySQL 8.0.18
